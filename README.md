**Project Goal**

To design and implement a robust, scalable data warehouse 🏗️ using MySQL to consolidate over three decades of English Premier League (EPL) statistical data, enabling complex historical analysis, trend reporting, and performance comparisons across seasons and teams.

**Scope and Data Coverage**

This project encompasses all available match and team statistics from the inception of the Premier League in the 1992/93 season up to the end of the 2020/21 season.

**Core Technical Objectives**

1. Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL): 🧼

Development of ETL scripts (potentially using Python or custom tooling) to clean, standardize, and integrate raw historical match data.

Focus on handling missing values, standardizing team names across different data sources, and ensuring data quality before loading.

2. Dimensional Data Modeling: 🌟

Implementation of a dimensional model (likely using a Star Schema) optimized for analytical queries.

Fact Tables (e.g., Match Results, Player Statistics) containing key performance indicators (KPIs) like goals, cards, and attendance.

Dimension Tables (e.g., Time/Season, Team, Manager, Venue) to provide context and enable hierarchical drill-down in reporting tools.

3. Database Implementation: 💻

Creation and optimization of the final data warehouse structure within MySQL, including defining primary/foreign keys and indexing for query performance.

**Analytical Capabilities**

The resulting data warehouse is engineered to support deep analytical queries: 🔎

1. Historical Performance: Tracking year-on-year changes in scoring, disciplinary actions, and league position stability.

2. Manager Comparison: 📈 Analyzing win rates and goal differentials for managers across their entire EPL tenure.

3. Team Trends: 🏟️ Identifying which teams historically outperform expectations based on home/away status.

4. Season-to-Season Volatility: Measuring variance in key metrics across the entire 29-season period.
